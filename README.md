#Title: Crypto

Description: This repository contains two Python scripts for encrypting and decrypting text files. The scripts use a simple encryption algorithm to convert the text to binary and then apply a XOR operation using a key. The encrypted text is then written to a new file with a ".enc" extension. The decryption script takes an encrypted file as input, converts it back to binary, applies the XOR operation using the same key, and writes the decrypted text to a new file with a ".dec" extension.

Files:

encrypt.py: Python script that encrypts a text file using a simple encryption algorithm.
decrypt.py: Python script that decrypts an encrypted text file using the same key used for encryption.
The scripts are designed to work with text files of any size and can be easily modified to use different encryption algorithms or keys. Feel free to use and modify the code for your own projects.

#LOOKING FORWARD FOR SOME IDEAS!
#THANK YOU FOR USING MY SCRIPTS
